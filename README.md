### About:

The software **Morse Decoder 2021** is a *console application* I wrote entirely using C# as my first software developed from scratch.

I started learning C# in February/2021 (just a few months after having my first experience with programming in general) and since then I was dealing only with tutorials and a lot of theory... so to push myself into some practical experience I developed this software here.

As an extra challenge I developed everything without LINQ, GENERICS and other things exactly to force myself to find a different solution to the challenges I encountered along the way.

Any feedback is welcome.
